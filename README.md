# Project Title

## Introduction
Brief introduction about the project.

## Standard Libraries
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import warnings
from IPython.display import clear_output

## PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim

## PyTorch Torchvision
import torchvision

## GeoOpt (for Hyperbolic Layers)
import geoopt
from geoopt.nn import MobiusLinear, use
```

## Installation
To use hyperbolic layers and functions, you need to install the `geoopt` library:
```bash
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt.git
```

## Fetching Example Script
If you want to fetch an example script for Mobius Linear, you can use the following command:
```bash
! [ ! -f mobius_linear_example.py ] && wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoopt/geoopt/master/examples/mobius_linear_example.py
```

## Setting Seed
Function for setting the seed:
```python
def set_seed(seed):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

set_seed(42)
torch.backends.cudnn.determinstic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

## Device
Fetching the device that will be used throughout this notebook:
```python
device = torch.device("cpu") if not torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cuda:0")
print("Using device", device)
```

## Usage
Explain how to use the provided code and functionalities.

## License
Mention the license under which the project is released.

## Acknowledgments
Any acknowledgments or credits.

## Contributions
Guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Authors
List of authors or contributors.
